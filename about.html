    <h1>CGS1200C About</h1>
    <p>Hello there, I am Logan Thompson. This is the website that I am making for my CGS1200C class. This class is about making websites more accessible to those with disabilities. I am having a lot of fun in this class and have learned a lot of new things. Hopefully I can better society in the future.</p>
